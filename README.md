# Name that colour - Sublime Text 3 snippets

> Generates a Sublime Text snippet for each colour, and returns its variable name

## Warning!

**This repo has been created for personal usage only. It doesn't provide colour suggestions for *non valid* colours. Once I'll create a proper function to manage it, I'll also publish it as a Sublime Text Package**

... Until that moment, you can still use it as described below.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `node generate-colours.js`
4. Copy the folder `NameThatColourSnippets` into your user packages folder (`/Users/{{ username }}/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/`).

## The result?

After you've added the snippets, you will be able to use them in every `*.scss` file:
